      <img src="https://replit.com/@OscarRomero23/HTML-Restaurant-Menu-1#assets/images/about.jpg" alt="Spices">
      <p>Siam was tired of his coding job and how disconnected he had become from his heritage. Being tired of his tech job, he looked at his fridge and became annoyed at the amount of bad food. He got inspired to connect back to his roots through some of his favorite family dishes. Since then, he has become obsessed with sharing the Thai dishes his parents made as a kid.</p>
